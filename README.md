iOS7CalculatorAssignment1
=========================
### Feb 3, 2014
The assignment is due today so I won't be updating this much beyond this. At least I'll have it here to look back on. Learned a lot about Xcode, mostly. I love how it plays with git.

Below is what works and what doesn't as the assignment stands.

If I get time to look back over it, I'll add functionality to the decimal button but poor planning on my part made that hard to add in hindsight.

### Working
* del button functions as hoped.
* simple math seems to work completely fine.
* Chaining operations seems to work completely fine.
* More complicated methods like 1/x, x^2, and x^3 are working fine. In fact, probably better than the more basic stuff.
* Square root has been added.
* Input is limited to a number of characters that can be adjusted in the code.
* +/- button functions as expected.

### Not working
* Needing to add functionality to the . button.
