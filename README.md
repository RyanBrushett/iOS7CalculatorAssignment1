=========================
### Working
* del button functions as hoped.
* simple math seems to work completely fine.
* Chaining operations seems to work completely fine.
* More complicated methods like 1/x, x^2, and x^3 are working fine. In fact, probably better than the more basic stuff.

### Not working
* Still trying to figure out how to limit the display to x digits elegantly. I may be onto something.
* Needing to add functionaliy to the +/- and . button. Need to finish square root.
