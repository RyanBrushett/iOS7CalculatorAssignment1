=========================
### Working
* del button functions as hoped.
* simple math seems to work completely fine.
* Chaining operations seems to work completely fine.
* More complicated methods like 1/x, x^2, and x^3 are working fine. In fact, probably better than the more basic stuff.
* Square root has been added.
* Input is limited to a number of characters that can be adjusted in the code.

### Not working
* Needing to add functionaliy to the +/- and . button.
